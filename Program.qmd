```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(Statamarkdown)
```

-   Primary definition: None of the parents have a bachelor's degree (but may have some college experience)

```{stata}
#| results: hide
gen first_gen1 = (parent1 <= 2 & parent2 <= 2)  
label var first_gen1 "First-generation college status (Yes/No)"

```

(Note: this is the definition used in analysis)

<br>

-   Alternative definition: All parents have high school or lower education (not even some college experience)

```{stata}
#| results: hide
gen first_gen2 = (parent1 == 1 & parent2 == 1)  
label var first_gen2 "First-generation college status_alt"

```

(Note: This more stringent definition resulted in a smaller sample size for first-generation student)

<br>

-   Label values of both versions of the variable

```{stata}
#| results: hide
label define yesno 0 "No" 1 "Yes"
label val first_gen1 first_gen2 yesno
```
